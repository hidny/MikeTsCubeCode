Counting shapes in 3D. As of now, 2 shapes that are rotationally symmetric in 3D are considered the same. (i.e. no reflections in 3D)
Get num pieces: 17,7
Final num pieces:
1023

Setup shuffle for pseudo-random sampling of tasks:
17
1027
secret key: 101
Sanity testing RSA shuffle:
Done sanity test for e = 17, d = 101, and n = 1027
Exp: 17
Mod: 1027

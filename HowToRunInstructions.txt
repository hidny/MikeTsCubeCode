Running the code from the command line: (Not recommended for large values of N)


Running the Optimized code that doesn't parallelize:

Go to NumPolyShapeSolveOptimized/DFSPolyCubeCounterOptimized3.java and hard-code the value of N to 12

Example:
You could set the number of cubes to be 12:
int N = 12;

Running the slower version of the code that's slightly easier to understand:

Go to NumPolyShapeSolve/DFSPolyCubeCounter.java and hard-code the value of N to 12


Michael@Felix MINGW64 ~/ProjectEuler2/PolycubeShapeCounter/src (main)
$ javac NumPolyShapeSolve/DFSPolyCubeCounter.java

Michael@Felix MINGW64 ~/ProjectEuler2/PolycubeShapeCounter/src (main)
$ java NumPolyShapeSolve/DFSPolyCubeCounter
Polycube counter program:
Current UTC timestamp in milliseconds: 1690172328372
